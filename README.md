# xpsArchRice
.rice folder containing scripts, wallpapers, and config files to be used with .switchTheme

light is solarized light, dark is solarized dark
This folder contains my scripts and wallpapers and some config files used in my archlinux installation on my xps13.
The config files included in this repo are limited to the ones which are changed by my switchthemes script.
Look in xpsDotfiles for the remaining, nonthemed dotfiles
